# Application Dependencies

This document provides an overview of the various services and technologies used in the deployment and operation of the application. It explains the purpose of each, how they are used, and why they were chosen.

## Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

### Purpose:
Amazon RDS is used to manage the relational database for the application. It simplifies tasks such as setup, operations, and scaling a relational database.

### How to Use:
- The application connects to the RDS instance using database connection strings.
- Database migrations are managed through our deployment process, ensuring the RDS schema is up to date.

### Why RDS:
- RDS allows us to focus on application development rather than database management.
- It offers built-in backups, patching, and scalability.

## Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)

### Purpose:
Amazon S3 is utilized for storing and retrieving any amount of data, such as application assets, user uploads, and logs.

### How to Use:
- Files are uploaded to S3 buckets using pre-signed URLs generated by the application backend.
- Assets are served directly to end-users via S3, reducing load on our servers.

### Why S3:
- S3 offers high availability and durability for stored files.
- It's cost-effective for storing large quantities of data and scales with use.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB)

### Purpose:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service used for deploying infrastructure which includes services like EC2, RDS, and S3.

### How to Use:
- Application code is packaged and uploaded to EB.
- EB automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.

### Why EB:
- EB abstracts away the infrastructure management, allowing us to focus on code development.
- It provides easy scaling and application monitoring.

## CircleCI

### Purpose:
CircleCI is a Continuous Integration and Delivery platform that automates the build, test, and deployment process.

### How to Use:
- Define workflows in `.circleci/config.yml` that run every time a commit is made to the repository.
- Use CircleCI to build the application, run tests, and deploy to EB when the master branch is updated.

### Why CircleCI:
- Automates the software development process with continuous integration and delivery.
- Helps to catch bugs early by running tests automatically on each commit.

## How These Components Fit Together

In the application's architecture:

1. **RDS** provides a managed relational database that stores application data persistently.
2. **S3** is used for object storage, hosting files and assets that the application serves.
3. **EB** manages the AWS infrastructure, including EC2 instances that run the application's code.
4. **CircleCI** watches for changes in the source code repository and triggers builds and deployments to Elastic Beanstalk.

By leveraging these services, the application benefits from the robustness, scalability, and efficiency of AWS, while CircleCI ensures that our deployment pipeline is consistent and automated.

Please refer to the individual documentation and best practices of each service for more detailed instructions and usage guidelines.
